<h1 class="main-content__title">A Little Japan in the Heart of Prague</h1>

<p class="main-content__paragraph">
    Founded in 2013, Yamato is a tribute to Japanese culture, aesthetics, and culinary art.  
    Since its beginning, it has earned recognition not only in the Czech Republic,  
    but also in Japan itself, where authenticity is held in the highest regard.
</p>

<p class="main-content__paragraph">
    Behind Yamato’s kitchen stands chef Richard Tomáš, holder of the Grand World Sushi Champion title,  
    which he won in Tokyo at the prestigious World Sushi Cup.  
    With his victory, he represented the Czech Republic among the world’s elite  
    and proved that true excellence in the art of sushi can be achieved even outside of Japan.
</p>

<p class="main-content__paragraph">
    The restaurant’s philosophy is deeply rooted in the principle of ichi-go ichi-e –  
    “one encounter, one unrepeatable moment.”  
    Each visit to Yamato is seen as a unique experience that cannot be replicated.  
    Every dish, every detail – all form a harmonious whole designed to delight the senses and leave a lasting impression.
</p>

<p class="main-content__paragraph">
    Yamato has become a favorite destination not only for Czech guests and visitors from around the world,  
    but also for the Japanese community, who often find here the taste and atmosphere of a true home.  
    Their appreciation means the most to us, as authenticity, respect for tradition,  
    and precise craftsmanship are the values on which we build.
